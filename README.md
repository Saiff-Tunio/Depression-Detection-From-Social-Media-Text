# 🧠 Depression Detection from Social Media Text

This repository is part of an ongoing research project aimed at detecting **signs of depression from social media text** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

## 📖 Project Overview

Social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) contain valuable linguistic cues that can be used to study mental health. This project focuses on exploring research directions, datasets, and techniques for **automatic depression detection**.

At this stage, the repository primarily contains **literature review material** and **knowledge extraction** from published papers.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- 📄 **Research Papers** → A collection of relevant publications on depression detection, sentiment analysis, and mental health monitoring.  
- 📊 **Extracted Information (Excel File)** → Key findings, methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics summarized from the papers.  

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ Literature review in progress  
✅ Extraction of key research findings into structured format  
⚠️ Model implementation **not yet uploaded**  

## 🚀 Future Work

- Collect depression-related social media datasets (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, Instagram).  
- Preprocess text (tokenization, cleaning, stopword removal, etc.).  
- Train and evaluate ML/DL models (e.g., BERT, LSTM, CNN).  
- Develop interpretable AI models for mental health applications.  
- Explore ethical concerns (privacy, bias, misuse).  

## 🛠️ Planned Tech Stack

- Python  
- NLP libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers  
- Deep Learning: TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Data handling: Pandas, NumPy  

## 🤝 Contributing

This is an early-stage research repository. Contributions are welcome, especially:  

- Adding new research papers or datasets  
- Summarizing additional findings  
- Suggesting potential approaches or models
